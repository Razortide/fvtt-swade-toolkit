# Description
SWADE Toolkit is the successor for SWADE Macros Simple. It includes a variety of tools (both macros and other more complicated Quality of Life improvements) that help with making the SWADE experience just a little bit better. 

All the features can be toggled on/off in the settings. If you have a problem with anything, please ask in the #swade channel in the Foundry Discord. 

## NPC Randomizer
![NPC_Randomizer](./readme_assets/npc_randomizer.png)

Select an actor template, pick compendiums to roll on, and it'll populate the actor with random items. It'll keep everything from the template except anything the SWADE system considers an "item"

## Compendium Patcher
![Compendium_Patcher](./readme_assets/compendium_patcher.png)
Pick a folder of actors, pick compendiums to use to patch them.
It'll go through each actor, and if it finds an item in the compendiums you've selected that matches the name of the actor's item, it'll replace it with the compendium item.

It will preserve skills die types.

Useful for updating descriptions and other info for imported actors that you might otherwise have as extensive compendiums.
